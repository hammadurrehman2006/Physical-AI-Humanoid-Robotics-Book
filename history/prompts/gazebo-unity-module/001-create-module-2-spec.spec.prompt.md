## Prompt

Create a Book Specification for Module 2: "The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)" including:

Module Structure - Break down into chapters and lessons covering Gazebo setup, URDF/SDF formats, physics simulation, sensor simulation, and Unity integration
Content Guidelines - Writing style for simulation tutorials, code standards for robot descriptions, visual asset requirements (simulation screenshots, videos)
Lesson Format - Template for simulation-based lessons with setup instructions, step-by-step exercises, and troubleshooting
Docusaurus Requirements - Sidebar organization, navigation from Module 1, file structure for Module 2
Assessment Integration - Define the "Gazebo simulation implementation" project details

Include chapter titles, lesson breakdown, and learning objectives for each section.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for Module 2: "The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)" with 6 prioritized user stories covering Gazebo setup, URDF/SDF formats, physics simulation, sensor simulation, Unity integration, and assessment project. Defined 12 functional requirements and 8 success criteria with measurable outcomes. Created validation checklist confirming specification quality.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete spec for Module 2 simulation content created
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: specs/002-gazebo-unity-module/spec.md, specs/002-gazebo-unity-module/checklists/requirements.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Plan development of Module 2 content
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification provides clear roadmap for Gazebo and Unity simulation content development

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A

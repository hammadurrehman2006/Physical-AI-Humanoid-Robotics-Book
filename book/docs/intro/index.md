# Welcome to Physical AI: Bridging Digital AI with Embodied Intelligence

## Introduction

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This book is designed to help you understand how to bridge the gap between digital artificial intelligence and embodied intelligence in physical systems.

### What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents the convergence of artificial intelligence with physical systems. Unlike traditional AI that operates in digital spaces, Physical AI works within embodied systems that interact with the real world through sensors, actuators, and mechanical structures.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this introduction, you will:
- Understand the foundations of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- Recognize the differences between digital AI and embodied intelligence
- Explore the current landscape of humanoid robotics
- Grasp why Physical AI is crucial for the future of robotics
- Learn about sensor systems and their role in physical intelligence
- Complete the necessary prerequisites to work with ROS 2

### Target Audience

This book is designed for:
- **Book Readers**: Beginners to intermediate learners looking to understand how to bridge digital AI with physical embodied intelligence
- **Educators**: Teachers and professors using this content for robotics courses
- **Developers**: Professionals implementing robotics solutions with ROS 2 architecture

### Prerequisites

Before diving into this book, you should have:
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with fundamental AI concepts
- Access to a development environment capable of running ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill

### About This Book

This book is structured into modules, each building upon the previous to provide a comprehensive understanding of Physical AI and humanoid robotics. Each lesson includes theory, code examples, and hands-on exercises to reinforce learning.

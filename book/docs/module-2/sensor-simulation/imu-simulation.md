# IMU Simulation in Gazebo

This tutorial covers implementing IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensor simulation in Gazebo. You'll learn how to configure realistic IMU sensors and validate their output.

## IMU Sensor Configuration

Configuring IMU sensors in Gazebo involves setting various parameters:

- Accelerometer properties
- Gyroscope properties
- Magnetometer properties (if applicable)
- Noise parameters

## Integration with ROS 2

Connecting Gazebo IMU sensors to ROS 2 topics for processing.

## Validation Techniques

Methods for validating that your IMU simulation produces realistic readings.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues with IMU simulation and their solutions.

# Material Properties and Physics Parameters

This tutorial covers configuring material properties and physics parameters in Gazebo simulations. You'll learn how to adjust friction, restitution, and other physical properties to create realistic simulation environments.

## Material Properties

In Gazebo, you can define various material properties that affect how objects interact:

- **Friction coefficients** - How objects slide against each other
- **Restitution** - Bounciness of objects during collisions
- **Density** - Mass distribution in objects

## Physics Engine Configuration

Gazebo supports multiple physics engines with different capabilities:

- ODE (Open Dynamics Engine)
- Bullet
- DART (Dynamic Animation and Robotics Toolkit)

## Configuration Examples

Examples of configuring physics properties in both URDF and SDF formats.

## Testing Physics Parameters

Methods for validating that your physics parameters produce realistic behavior.

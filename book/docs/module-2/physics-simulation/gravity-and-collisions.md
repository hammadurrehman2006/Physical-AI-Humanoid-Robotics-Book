# Gravity and Collisions in Gazebo

This tutorial covers implementing physics simulation with gravity and collisions in Gazebo. You'll learn how to configure realistic physics parameters and create environments that accurately simulate real-world physics.

## Physics Configuration

Gazebo provides a robust physics engine that can simulate various physical properties including gravity, friction, and collision detection.

## Setting Up Gravity

To configure gravity in your simulation:

1. Define the gravity vector in your world file
2. Configure the physics engine parameters
3. Test the gravity effects on your robot models

## Collision Detection

Gazebo handles collision detection between different objects in your simulation environment.

## Troubleshooting

Common physics simulation issues and their solutions.

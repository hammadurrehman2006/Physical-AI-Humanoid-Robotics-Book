# Environment Modeling and Physics Simulation

This tutorial focuses on creating complex environments for physics simulation in Gazebo. You'll learn how to model different types of environments and configure physics parameters for various scenarios.

## Environment Types

Different types of simulation environments you can create:

- Indoor environments (rooms, corridors, buildings)
- Outdoor environments (terrain, obstacles)
- Complex multi-room environments

## World File Configuration

Creating and configuring Gazebo world files with appropriate physics settings.

## Advanced Physics Concepts

- Joint friction and damping
- Contact surface properties
- Multi-body dynamics
- Soft body simulation

## Performance Optimization

Tips for optimizing physics simulation performance while maintaining accuracy.

# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book! This module focuses on creating digital twins of physical robots using simulation environments. You'll learn how to build realistic simulation environments using Gazebo for physics simulation and Unity for high-fidelity visualization.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you'll master:
- Setting up and configuring Gazebo simulation environments
- Creating robot models using URDF and SDF formats
- Implementing physics simulations with realistic gravity and collision detection
- Adding sensor simulations (LiDAR, cameras, IMUs) to your robots
- Integrating Unity for high-fidelity visualization and human-robot interaction

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should:
- Have completed Module 1 (ROS 2 Fundamentals)
- Have ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill installed
- Have basic Python programming knowledge

## Module Structure

This module is organized into several key sections:
1. **Gazebo Environment Setup** - Installing and configuring Gazebo
2. **URDF/SDF Formats** - Creating robot models with proper descriptions
3. **Physics Simulation** - Implementing realistic physics in your simulations
4. **Sensor Simulation** - Adding various sensors to your robots
5. **Unity Integration** - Connecting Unity for high-fidelity visualization
6. **Assessment Project** - A comprehensive project to demonstrate your skills

Let's begin by setting up your Gazebo environment!

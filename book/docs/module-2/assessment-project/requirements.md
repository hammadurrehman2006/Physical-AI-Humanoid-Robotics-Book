# Assessment Project Requirements

This document outlines the specific requirements for the Module 2 assessment project. Your project must meet all mandatory requirements to pass the assessment.

## Mandatory Requirements

### Robot Model (25 points)
- Create a robot model using URDF or SDF format
- Include at least 3 links and 2 joints
- Define proper visual, collision, and inertial properties
- Include appropriate materials and textures

### Gazebo Environment (25 points)
- Create a custom world file with obstacles
- Configure physics properties (gravity, friction, etc.)
- Include static and dynamic objects in the environment
- Demonstrate proper collision detection

### Sensor Integration (25 points)
- Integrate at least 3 different sensor types:
  - LiDAR sensor
  - Camera sensor
  - IMU sensor
- Configure appropriate sensor parameters
- Validate sensor output data

### Navigation (25 points)
- Implement basic navigation in the simulation
- Demonstrate robot movement and obstacle avoidance
- Show interaction between robot and environment

## Optional Requirements (Bonus: up to 20 points)
- Unity integration for high-fidelity visualization
- Advanced sensor fusion techniques
- Complex environment with multiple robots

## Evaluation Criteria

Projects will be evaluated based on:
- Completeness of implementation
- Correctness of simulation behavior
- Quality of documentation
- Code organization and structure

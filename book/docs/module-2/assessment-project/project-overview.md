# Module 2 Assessment Project Overview

This document provides an overview of the Module 2 assessment project. In this project, you'll create a complete simulation environment that demonstrates your understanding of Gazebo simulation, robot modeling, physics simulation, sensor integration, and Unity visualization.

## Project Objectives

The Module 2 assessment project requires you to:

1. Create a robot model using URDF/SDF
2. Set up a Gazebo simulation environment with physics properties
3. Integrate multiple sensors (LiDAR, camera, IMU) on your robot
4. Implement basic navigation in the simulated environment
5. Optionally integrate with Unity for high-fidelity visualization

## Project Requirements

Your project must include:

- A complete robot model with appropriate URDF/SDF description
- A Gazebo world with obstacles and navigation challenges
- At least 3 different sensor types integrated on the robot
- Documentation of your simulation setup and configuration

## Submission Guidelines

Detailed instructions for project submission and evaluation criteria.

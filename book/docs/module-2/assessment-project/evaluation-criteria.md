# Evaluation Criteria

This document defines the grading standards and evaluation criteria for the Module 2 assessment project.

## Grading Rubric

### Robot Model Implementation (25 points)
- **Excellent (22-25 points)**: Complete robot model with proper URDF/SDF, all properties correctly defined, realistic appearance and physics
- **Good (18-21 points)**: Robot model with most properties defined, minor issues with physics or appearance
- **Satisfactory (13-17 points)**: Basic robot model with some properties missing or incorrectly configured
- **Needs Improvement (0-12 points)**: Incomplete or incorrect robot model

### Gazebo Environment Setup (25 points)
- **Excellent (22-25 points)**: Complex environment with realistic physics, proper world configuration, advanced features
- **Good (18-21 points)**: Good environment setup with basic physics, minor configuration issues
- **Satisfactory (13-17 points)**: Basic environment with simple physics, some configuration issues
- **Needs Improvement (0-12 points)**: Incomplete environment setup

### Sensor Integration (25 points)
- **Excellent (22-25 points)**: All required sensors properly integrated, realistic data output, advanced configuration
- **Good (18-21 points)**: Most sensors integrated with good configuration, minor data issues
- **Satisfactory (13-17 points)**: Basic sensor integration with acceptable data output
- **Needs Improvement (0-12 points)**: Incomplete or incorrect sensor integration

### Navigation Implementation (25 points)
- **Excellent (22-25 points)**: Advanced navigation with obstacle avoidance, smooth movement, complex behaviors
- **Good (18-21 points)**: Good navigation with basic obstacle avoidance, mostly smooth movement
- **Satisfactory (13-17 points)**: Basic navigation with some movement capabilities
- **Needs Improvement (0-12 points)**: Incomplete or non-functional navigation

## Bonus Points (up to 20 points)
- Unity integration: up to 10 points
- Advanced sensor fusion: up to 5 points
- Complex multi-robot scenarios: up to 5 points

## Documentation (pass/fail)
- Project must include clear documentation of setup, implementation, and results
- Code must be properly commented and organized
- Issues with documentation may result in grade reduction

# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System - ROS 2

## Introduction to ROS 2

Welcome to Module 1, where we explore the backbone of modern robotics: ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2). Just as the nervous system coordinates actions in biological organisms, ROS 2 provides the communication infrastructure that enables robotic systems to function cohesively.

### What is ROS 2?

ROS 2 is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Master the fundamental architecture of ROS 2
- Understand nodes, topics, services, and actions in robotic systems
- Learn how to bridge Python agents to ROS controllers using rclpy
- Build your first ROS 2 packages
- Work with launch files and parameters
- Understand URDF for humanoid robots

### Module Structure

This module is divided into several lessons, each focusing on a specific aspect of ROS 2:

1. **ROS 2 Architecture**: Understanding the core concepts and design principles
2. **Nodes, Topics, and Services**: Communication patterns in ROS 2
3. **Actions in Robotic Systems**: Long-running tasks and feedback mechanisms
4. **Python-rclpy Bridge**: Connecting Python agents to ROS controllers
5. **Building ROS 2 Packages**: Creating modular and reusable code
6. **Launch Files and Parameters**: Managing complex robotic systems
7. **URDF for Humanoids**: Robot description for humanoid systems

### Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed the Introduction section
- Python 3.10+ installed
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with command line tools

### Assessment Project

At the end of this module, you'll complete a comprehensive assessment project that integrates all the concepts learned in this module, demonstrating your understanding of ROS 2 fundamentals.
